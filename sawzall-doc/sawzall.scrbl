@defmodule[sawzall]

@bold{TODO:} needs examples, hard to find ones that make sense...?
current examples pilfered from Chez

Sawzall is a grammar for manipulating data, and provides a set of primitives that allow solving
common data-manipulation problems in a style similar to spreadsheets. Sawzall uses the
@racketmodname[data-frame] library as its primary object of input and output, and is designed to
manipulate these data-frames.

Sawzall is designed with the @racketmodname[threading] library in mind. While it is possible to use
without it, most operations will be more natural expressed with @racket[~>].

Many examples in this documentation will be based around the following simple frame:
@examples[#:eval ev #:label #f
  (define example-df
    (row-df [grp trt adult juv]
             "a" "b" 1     10
             "a" "b" 2     20
             "b" "a" 3     30
             "b" "b" 4     40
             "b" "b" 5     50))
]

@section[#:tag "constructors"]{Constructing data-frames}

These are constructors for data-frames that may be more ergonomic than @racket[make-data-frame].
Generally, while doing data analysis, you want to use @racket[df-read/csv] or a similar function
to read in real-world data from some source. If you are constructing data from a Racket program,
however, these may be useful.

@defform[(column-df [column-name column-data] ...)
         #:contracts ([column-name (or/c identfier? string?)]
                      [column-data vector?])]{
  Constructs a data-frame with the given @racket[column-name]s, with each @racket[column-data]
  as the data in each column.

  @racket[column-name] can either be an identifier or an expression that evaluates to a string.
  If it is an identifier, it will be taken literally.

  @examples[#:eval ev
    (show (column-df [x (vector 1 2 3)]
                     [(string-append "a" "b") (vector "a" "b" "c")]))
  ]
}

@defform[(row-df [column-name ...] value ...)]{
  Constructs a data-frame with the given @racket[column-name]s, row-by-row with the given
  @racket[value]s.

  This method runs in quadratic time, but it is executed solely at compile time, so
  its performance should be roughly equivalent to that of @racket[column-df].
}

@section[#:tag "display"]{Displaying data}

@defproc[(show [df (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)] [#:all? all? boolean? #f]) void?]{
  Displays a data-frame @racket[df], alongside with grouping information (if it exists).
  Designed solely for interactive use. Also see @racket[df-describe], which presents summary statistics
  about a given data-frame.

  By default, six rows and six columns are shown (along with the names of each column), and the rest
  are elided. The columns shown are an in an unspecified order (as is @racket[df-series-names]). To
  display the entirety of @racket[df], pass @racket[#:all #t]: but this is likely to be overwhelming
  for large data-frames.

  @examples[#:eval ev
    (show example-df)
  ]
}

@defproc[(introspect [df (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)] [#:all? all? boolean? #f])
         (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]{
  Like @racket[show], but returns its input. Useful for looking at the intermediate frame in a
  @racket[~>] chain, and then continuing processing.
}

@section[#:tag "grouping"]{Grouping and splitting}

@subsection{Grouping}

The overwhelming majority of operations in Sawzall respect the "grouping" of a data-frame. Most
operations are done on groups defined by variables, so grouping takes an existing frame and converts
it into a grouped one, in which operations are performed by group.

@defproc[(grouped-data-frame? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
  Determines if the input @racket[v] is a grouped data-frame. These can only be constructed by
  @racket[group-with], or as the result on another operation on an existing grouped data-frame.
}

@defproc[(group-with [df data-frame?] [var string?] ...) grouped-data-frame?]{
  Takes an existing data-frame @racket[df], and groups it with respect to the given variables
  @racket[var] sequentially, returning a grouped data frame.

  This does not change how the data-frame is displayed with @racket[show] or @racket[introspect], but
  the result is internally different, and cannot be used with regular data-frame operators like
  @racket[df-select].

  @examples[#:eval ev
    (~> example-df
        (group-with "grp" "trt")
        show)
  ]
}

@defproc[(ungroup-all [df (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]) data-frame?]{
  Removes all levels of grouping from a grouped data frame, returning a singular data frame. In most cases,
  you'll want to do this before passing your wrangled data to some other application.

  If @racket[df] is not grouped, this does nothing.
}

@defproc[(ungroup-once [df (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]) (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]{
  Removes the last level of grouping from a grouped data frame. For example, if a grouped frame is grouped
  by X and Y, running @racket[ungroup-once] it would make it grouped by just X.

  If @racket[df] is not grouped, this does nothing.
}

@subsection{Splitting}

The following operations behave similar to the above counterparts, but they return a list instead of a
grouped data frame, so you must use @racket[map] to do sequential groups or perform operations.

@defproc[(split-with [df data-frame?] [var string?]) (listof data-frame?)]{
  Splits the given data-frame @racket[df] along the input variable @racket[var], returning a list of each
  possibility.
}

@defproc[(combine [df data-frame?] ...) data-frame?]{
  Appends the shared series of the input data-frames into a single data-frame.
}

@section[#:tag "where"]{Filtering}

@defform[(where df (bound-column ...) body ...)
         #:contracts ([df (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)])]{
  Returns @racket[df], except only rows in which @racket[body] returns true are kept.

  The bound variables in @racket[body] are values of the given @racket[bound-column]s. The frame is
  iterated upon, and for each row, @racket[body] is checked with the given bound variables.

  @examples[#:eval ev
    (~> example-df
        (where (adult) (> adult 3))
        show)
    (~> example-df
        (where (grp juv) (and (string=? grp "b") (< juv 50)))
        show)
  ]
}

@section[#:tag "create"]{Creating and modifying columns}

@defform/subs[#:literals (vector : element data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)
              (create df [new-column (binder ...) body ...] ...)
              [(df (code:line data-frame?)
                   grouped-data-frame?)
               (binder (code:line bound-column)
                       [bound-column : type])
               (type (code:line element)
                     vector)]]{
  Returns @racket[df], except with a derived column, or multiple derived columns. If the given column is
  already present in the data-frame, it will be (immutably) overridden, and otherwise it will be created.

  Each new column is specified by a single clause. The column created will have the name @racket[new-column],
  and be specified by the expressions in @racket[body].

  The bound variables in @racket[body] are specified by @racket[binder]. Each bound variable either has the type
  @racket[element], which binds a single element of the given column and maps over it, or @racket[vector],
  which binds the entire column. If a type for a bound variable is not specified, it defaults to
  @racket[element].

  If every bound variable in a given column specification is of type @racket[vector], it is expected that
  @racket[body] produces a vector of the same length as all other columns. Otherwise, it is expected that
  @racket[body] produces some quantity, and it will be mapped over every column specified by variables of type
  @racket[element].

  @examples[#:eval ev
    (define (v/ vec c) (vector-map (Î» (v) (/ v c)) vec))
    (define (sum vec)
      (for/sum ([v (in-vector vec)])
        v))

    (~> example-df
        (create [total (adult juv) (+ adult juv)]
                [grp (grp) (string-append "blerg" grp)]
                [freq ([juv : vector]) (v/ juv (sum juv))])
        show)
  ]
}

@defproc[(rename [df (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]
                 [from string?] [to string?] ...)
         (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]{
  Returns @racket[df], except with each column with name @racket[from] renamed to @racket[to].

  @examples[#:eval ev
    (~> example-df
        (rename "grp" "waldo"
                "trt" "warbly")
        show)
  ]
}

@section[#:tag "aggregate"]{Summarizing}

@defform[(aggregate df [new-column (bound-column ...) body ...] ...)
         #:contracts ([df (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)])]{
  Creates a new frame with the grouping information (if any) and new aggregated columns as specified. The
  new data-frame will have only columns corresponding to the groups of the frame and the new derived columns.
  It is likely you want to use @racket[group-with] first (or else you'll end up with just a single value).

  Each new column is specified by a single clause. The column created will have the name @racket[new-column],
  and be specified by the expressions in @racket[body].

  The bound variables in @racket[body] are specified by @racket[bound-column]. Unlike @racket[create], all
  variables bound in @racket[body] are the entirety of the column as a vector. @racket[body] is expected to
  produce a single value, which is the "aggregation" of that vector.

  If the input is a grouped data-frame, the last layer of grouping will be implicitly removed after
  aggregating.

  @examples[#:eval ev
    (~> example-df
        (aggregate [sum (adult) (vector-length adult)])
        show)
    (~> example-df
        (group-with "grp")
        (aggregate [adult-sum (adult) (sum adult)]
                   [juv-sum (juv) (sum juv)])
        show)
    (~> example-df
        (group-with "grp" "trt")
        (aggregate [adult-sum (adult) (sum adult)]
                   [juv-sum (juv) (sum juv)])
        show)
  ]
}

@section[#:tag "join"]{Joining}

These operations join two tables in varying ways, along some common column (the "spine").

All joining operations ignore grouping. The grouping of the first argument will be preserved,
but grouping does not play a factor in how the operation performs (compared to a plain table).

The following example data-frames are used in this section:
@examples[#:eval ev #:label #f
  (define woodland1
    (row-df [site habitat]
             "b"  "grassland"
             "a"  "meadow"
             "c"  "woodland"))
  (define woodland2
    (row-df [site day catch]
             "c"  1   10
             "b"  1   12
             "c"  2   20
             "b"  2   24))
]

@subsection{Combining joins}

These joins combine variables from the two input data-frames.

@defproc[(left-join [df1 (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]
                    [df2 (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]
                    [by string?]
                    [#:cmp? cmp? (-> any/c any/c boolean?) orderable<?])
         (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame/?)]{
  Returns a new data-frame, with all rows from @racket[df1], and all columns from @racket[df1]
  and @racket[df2]. Rows are compared by the value of the variable @racket[by].

  Rows in @racket[df1] that have no corresponding value of @racket[by] in @racket[df2] will have
  NA values in the new columns.

  Rows in @racket[df1] that have multiple corresponding values of @racket[by] in @racket[df2]
  will have all combinations of the @racket[df1] and @racket[df2] values in the result.

  @racket[cmp?] is used to sort the two data-frames before joining. By default, this is
  @racket[orderable<?], which is in essence a "best guess" comparator.

  @examples[#:eval ev
    (~> woodland1
        (left-join woodland2 "site")
        show)
    (~> woodland2
        (left-join woodland1 "site")
        show)
  ]
}

@defproc[(right-join [df1 (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]
                     [df2 (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]
                     [by string?]
                     [#:cmp? cmp? (-> any/c any/c boolean?) orderable<?])
         (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]{
  Returns a new data-frame, with all rows from @racket[df2], and all columns from @racket[df1]
  and @racket[df2]. Rows are compared by the value of the variable @racket[by].

  This is equivalent to @racket[(left-join df2 df1 by #:cmp? cmp?)].
}

@defproc[(inner-join [df1 (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]
                     [df2 (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]
                     [by string?]
                     [#:cmp? cmp? (-> any/c any/c boolean? orderable<?)])
         (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]{
  Returns a new data-frame, with all rows from @racket[df1] with matching rows in @racket[df2],
  and columns of both @racket[df1] and @racket[df2]. Rows are compared by the value of the variable
  @racket[by].

  If there are multiple matches between the rows of @racket[df1] and @racket[df2], all combinations
  of the matches are returned.

  @racket[cmp?] is used to sort the two data-frames before joining.

  @examples[#:eval ev
    (~> woodland1
        (inner-join woodland2 "site")
        show)
  ]
}

@defproc[(full-join [df1 (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]
                    [df2 (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]
                    [by string?]
                    [#:cmp? cmp? (-> any/c any/c boolean? orderable<?)])
         (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]{
  Returns a new data-frame, with all rows and columns from @racket[df1] and @racket[df2]. Rows are
  compared by the value of the variable @racket[by].

  If there is a row in @racket[df1] that does not have a value in @racket[df2], or vice versa, they
  will have NA values in the new columns.

  @racket[cmp?] is used to sort the two data-frames before joining.

  @examples[#:eval ev
    (~> woodland2
        (full-join woodland1 "site")
        show)
  ]
}

@subsection{Filtering joins}

These joins keep cases solely from the left-hand (first argument) data-frame.

@bold{Unimplemented.}

@subsection{Nesting join}

This join creates a column in its result that is a list of other values.

@bold{Unimplemented.}

@section[#:tag "reorder"]{Sorting}

@defproc[(reorder [df (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]
                  [column-spec (or/c string? (cons/c string? (-> any/c any/c boolean?)))]
                  [#:in-groups in-groups? boolean? #f]
                  ...)
         (or/c data-frame? grouped-data-frame?)]{
  Returns @racket[df], except sorted by a series of columns. Each @racket[column-spec] is either a column
  name, or a pair of a column name and a comparator.

  If no comparator is specified, it defaults to @racket[orderable<?], which will cause an ascending sort
  for most types of data.

  If a custom ordering is specified, it should be a strict ordering (so, if objects are @racket[equal?],
  the comparator should return false). Otherwise, @racket[group-with] and other operations involving
  binary search will behave unexpectedly.

  Note that reordering ensures that the first @racket[column-spec] is truly sorted. The subsequent
  @racket[column-spec]s are used to break the ties (i.e. two values are @racket[equal?]).

  This operation ignores grouping by default, and instead sorts the entire data-frame. To sort by group,
  use @racket[#:in-groups? #t].

  @examples[#:eval ev
    (~> example-df
        (reorder (cons "trt" string-ci>?)
                 (cons "adult" >))
        show)
    (~> example-df
        (group-with "grp")
        (reorder (cons "adult" >) #:in-groups? #t)
        show)
  ]
}

@defproc[(by-vector [vec vector?]) (-> any/c any/c boolean?)]{
  Returns a comparator based on the positions in the given input vector @racket[vec].

  This is useful for "replacing" a column in a frame, while retaining the order of observations.

  @examples[#:eval ev
    (~> example-df
        (reorder (cons "juv" (by-vector (vector 50 20 30 10 40))))
        show)
  ]
}

@defproc[(orderable? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
  Determines if the given type of value @racket[v] can be sorted against another @racket[orderable?]
  by @racket[orderable<?].

  @racket[v] must be one of @racket[boolean?], @racket[char?], @racket[real?], @racket[symbol?],
  @racket[keyword?], @racket[string?], @racket[null?], @racket[void?], or @racket[eof-object?].

  This does not guarantee that @racket[orderable<?] will succeed. For example, @racket[orderable<?] will
  error if given two @racket[void?]s.
}

@defproc[(orderable<? [a orderable?] [b orderable?]) boolean?]{
  A generic comparator to determine if @racket[a] is less than @racket[b].

  Used by default by joins and @racket[reorder].
}

@section[#:tag "pivoting"]{Pivoting}

@defproc[(pivot-longer [df data-frame?] [cols (non-empty-listof string?)]
                       [#:names-to names-to string?]
                       [#:values-to values-to string?])
         data-frame?]{
  Returns a new data-frame that is the input @racket[df] pivoted "longer", so less columns,
  more rows. This is useful for tidying wide-form data.

  @racket[cols] are the columns to pivot (the ones to switch from wide form). Any column not
  in @racket[cols] will be brought along so that former observations line up, but its data will
  not be modified.

  All the names of every column in @racket[cols] is brought into a new column with name @racket[names-to],
  and all the values are brought into a new column with name @racket[values-to].

  This function does not work with grouped data frames, as it has potential to destroy some internal
  invariants.

         data-frame?]{
  Returns a new data-frame that is the input @racket[df] pivoted "wider", so less rows, more columns.
  This is useful for putting data into "wide form", optimized for data entry for export into spreadsheet
  software like Excel, or for some convoluted tidying pipeline.

  @racket[names-from] is the column to create new columns from, and @racket[values-from] is the column to
  get the corresponding data from.

  If a value is not found in the long format data-frame, it will be replaced with "NA" (@racket[#f]).
